ZSF documentation
=================

This is the documentation for the ZSF, a `Deltares <https://www.deltares.nl/>`_ tool to calculate salt intrusion through shipping locks.
The documentation covers:

    - How to get the ZSF running on your computer.
      For end-users this means downloading either the Excel workbook, or installing the Python package.
    - Making your own calculations, by means of several illustrative examples for both the Excel workbook and Python package.
    - The theory on which the ZSF is based, serving as background information on the inner workings of the libzsf core.
    - An overview of the C and Python API, e.g. to embed the ZSF in other software.

.. note::

    ZSF is an abbreviation for "Zeesluisformulering", which would translate to Sea Lock Formulation.
